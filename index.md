I have something to tell you, dear reader. **The web is fucked and there's nothing we can do about it.** It's a sad state of affairs that we're in - gone are the days of Web 1.0 where the humble personal blog and the likes of [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) reigned supreme.

Instead we've been left with Web 1.0's rotten remains where centralisation, monopolies and tracking are the order of the day. *It's shit*.

The Internet has been monetised by social media, my big tech, by search engines. Fuck, it's been monetised by pretty much everyone. The whole concept of [netizens](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/netizen) and a community around the web, from the late 90s and early 00s, have been lost to the sands of time. *Again, it's shit.*

**This is my manifesto; a warning to everyone who uses the web. It's fucked and it's not gonna change.**

**Content warning:** If you hadn't noticed already, this manifesto is not suitable for work as it contains curse words throughout.

## What was Web 1.0?
I suppose a good place to start would be with some context. If you weren't a user of the Internet back in the 90s and 00s, then you're not likely to know what [Web 1.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0#Web_1.0) was.

In short, it was glorious. Many people had personal web sites, usually published on GeoCities, where exploring the web was a fun adventure that was *not* fuelled by algorithms.

You could find all kinds of web pages, about all kinds of topics. Search engine optimisation didn't exist. Fuck, there were *no search engines* in the early days.

If you wanted to find something, you had to hunt for it and that was all part of the fun. There's a reason it's called *surfing the web* and that traditional browsers, like Netscape Navigator, had a nautical theme.

You would wander aimlessly through the wilds of the Internet, constantly perusing all the great content that netizens were putting out into the world. You wouldn't hit a search, find something you wanted to read, then leave.

That's too surgical. Too informal. It was a community. We were netizens.

I fondly remember perusing Web 1.0 and reading anything from blogs about The Simpsons, to *very* personal updates, and everything in between. [GeoCities neighbourhoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities#Neighborhoods) were great fun to wade through and learn about *so much* stuff.

It very much was *not* shit.

### Web 1.0 design
Websites of today tend to follow a tried and tested paradigm when it comes to design. Sure, things differ slightly, but it's generally the same script:

* A couple of colours with large amounts of white space
* A header that contains a hamburger menu
* Mahoosive features images
* Ridiculous large and over-complicated frameworks
* All the JavaScript
* All the tracking
* All the adverts
* Maybe, just *maybe*, some useful content

Back in the Web 1.0 days, web design (if you can call it that) was *very* different to how it is today. Scrolling marquees, blinking text, all the GIFs. It was great fun!

CSS was still in its infancy, so you couldn't do all the cool stuff we can do today, which meant people had to think outside the box. Sure, accessibility was pretty low down the people's priorities (read: not there at all) but some of the designs were amazing, unique and most of all, interesting.

Look at those glorious manifestations of 90s web design! Quite a lot different from the cookie-cutter design of today, right?

Lucky for us, there are still some parts of the Internet that are [weirdly wonderful](https://weirdwidewebring.net/) and [wildly whimsical](https://whimsical.club/).

## Then came Web 2.0
This is where things all start to go to rat shit. Web 2.0 is when a shift to social media and interactive platforms came about.

Instead of having interesting content creators sharing their experiences and knowledge on their personal blogs, guestbooks and forums, we started to see pictures of people's lunch, political and social hyperbole and a whole load of other shit to boot.

### Fuck social media
The rise of social media flipped content creation on its head. Instead of deliberately creating and editing content for static sites, people were now empowered to quickly and easily vomit their passing thoughts out to the world.

On the face of things, this may sounds great. Social media is empowering people to easily create content online, allowing anyone with an Internet connection to have a voice.

The problem here, dear reader, is that social media was never about empowering people. Nope, was it fuck. It was all about one thing...

**MONEY!**

All that time you spend reading about that person from school you've never spoken to, you're being tracked like a mother fucker.

Facebook is by far the worst offender for this. If they wanted to, those fuckers would be able to tell how bad your shit smells. But why all the tracking? Well, again it comes down to one thing...money.

They track you so they can use this data to display more targeted ads on the platform. By having highly targeted ads, you're more likely to click; and if you're more likely to click, they make more money.

**[Mark Zuckerberg doesn't give two shits about your privacy](https://www.businessinsider.com/well-these-new-zuckerberg-ims-wont-help-facebooks-privacy-problems-2010-5?r=US&IR=T) - if you're a Facebook user, you should be re-considering your life choices.**

### Fuck search engines
Although Zuckerberg and his merry band of wankers have a lot to answer for, the death of web 1.0 and the humble personal blog is not their fault alone. Search plays a huge part in this shit show too.

Back in the day, search engines were rudimentary at best, but they have since grown into these Goliaths were even [Google don't really understand how their shit works](https://www.seroundtable.com/google-dont-understand-rankbrain-21744.html).

In some ways this is good, as we get far more accurate search results. But it also has 2 very important problems too. Let me explain...

Firstly, as with social media, *it's all about money*. So the humble personal blog is often left out of search rankings, and is replaced my corporate entities that have teams of people on-hand who can manipulate the search rankings to their will.

This is known as *Search Engine Optimisation* (SEO) in the industry.

The second problem is that because of all the aforementioned tracking, your Google search results become an echo chamber. You see, Google learns as you search and the more data you feed it, the more "accurate" the results become for you.

Try it yourself, do a Google search for something on your normal browser, then [download the TOR browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) and try the same search again. I guarantee the results will be different.

It's a double whammy. Corporate website owners are manipulating results so you're more likely to see their shitty listicle posts instead of actual useable content that has been written by someone competent. And to add insult to injury, Google are also manipulating the results based on you a shit tonne of data they have tracked you with.

With all of this manipulation of results, you're likely to get the results you *think* you want, but you're unlikely to get the *best* results.

You could write *the best*, most informed post on any given topic, but if it isn't "search engine optimised" it will never see the light of day.

This has effectively killed off the humble personal blog. [Personal blogging isn't dead yet](https://metaletter.net/issue-01/), but it's *extremely* difficult to gain any traction with a blog these days.

Google et al where supposed to make content discovery easier. What the fuck happened?

## Don't fuck yourself
This is all very negative, isn't it. So let's inject some positivity into this shit show, shall we? *The web is fucked* that's a fact. But there are still ways you can take Web 1.0 and sprinkle it with a little Web 2.0 so that you can use it to your advantage.

### Don't be a social media shill
I'm not saying you should avoid all social media - that shit's pretty much impossible these days and is reserved mainly for social pariahs.

But you can choose which social platforms you use and how to use them so that it's done in a healthy way. Here's some tips:

* Get the fuck off Facebook. That shit is a cancer.
* Look for decentralised alternatives, like [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org).
* [Break your dopamine addiction](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/dopamine-smartphones-battle-time/) and turn off **all** notifications from social media. This way you check it when you want to, rather then when it tells you to.
* Familiarise yourself with [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) and make your site the single source of truth for all your online content.

## Discovering Web 1.0 content in a Web 2.0 world
GeoCities is long gone. It's dead, Jim. But there are still ways of discovering netizen generated content, despite all the shit I've written about above.

[Neocities](https://neocities.org) is a modern day implementation of GeoCities and it's chock full of a great sites that would have fitted nicely into the Internet of the 90s and 00s.

![Neocities website browser](/assets/images/neocities-browser.webp)

Just like on GeoCities, you can spin up your own site for free, and for a mere $5/month you can have things like a custom domain etc. It's great.

If you want to get *really* nostalgic, there are even pages on Neocities that are [similar to GeoCities neighbourhoods](https://districts.neocities.org/).

If Neocities isn't your thing and you want to discover more modern personal blogs ([like mine](https://kevq.uk/posts)) then I got you covered there too. Sites like [Blog Surf](https://blogsurf.io/) and [Personalsit.es](https://personalsit.es/) can help you discover some great personal sites.

Also look for a [blogroll](https://kevq.uk/blogroll) on personal websites you come across. If you own a website, **add a blogroll to your site**. It will help people discover content you enjoy without the need for Google's gaggle of gob shites.

## What about Web 3.0?
Don't worry, we're getting close to end now folks, but I wanted to quickly touch upon [Web 3.0 and the Metaverse](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-what-is-metaverse-and-web-30-060003351.html). If you don't know what these are; the Metaverse is what that dickhead Zuckerberg is pushing with Meta. And Web 3.0 is basically putting all the things on blockchain.

Yeah, fuck that. Fuck blockchain. Fuck Meta. Fuck Zuck the schmuck. That's all I have to say about that.

## Fuck this
I'm done. There you have it, that's my manifesto about how fucked the web is. Look, we will never get the web of old back and let's be honest, it wasn't perfect either. The web of today is more accessible, more dynamic and pretty much a cornerstone of our society.

But a long as we use the web with our eyes open and try to take advantage of the few positives the web still provides, it *may* not be that bad.

Then again, the web might be completely and utterly fucked and it's only gonna get worse. One thing is for sure, if Zuck the crook has anything to do with Web 3.0, things will *definitely* get worse.
