I have something to tell you, dear reader. **The web is fucked and there's nothing we can do about it.** It's a sad state of affairs that we're in - gone are the days of Web 1.0 where the humble personal blog and GeoCities reigned supreme.

Instead we've been left with Web 1.0's rotten remains where centralisation, monopolies and tracking are the order of the day. It's shit.

The Internet has been monetised by social media, my big tech, by search engines. Fuck, it's been monetised by pretty much everyone apart from those intrepid [netizens](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/netizen) from back in the late 90s and early 00s.

**This is my manifesto. A warning to everyone who uses the web; it's fucked and it's not gonna change.**

{: .notice}
**Content warning:** If you hadn't noticed already, this manifesto is not suitable for work as it contains curse words throughout.

## What is Web 1.0?
I suppose a good place to start would be with some context. If you weren't a user of the Internet back in the 90s and 00s, then you're not likely to know what [Web 1.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0#Web_1.0) was.

In short, it was glorious. Many people had personal web sites, usually published on GeoCities, where exploring the web was a fun adventure that wasn't fuelled by algorithms.

*GeoCities homepage circa 1999*

You would find all kinds of web pages, about all kinds of topics. Search engine optimisation didn't exist, fuck, there were *no search engines* in the early days.

If you wanted to find something, you had to hunt for it and that was all part of the fun. There's a reason it's called *surfing the web* and that traditional browsers, like Netscape Navigator, had a nautical theme.

I fondly remember perusing Web 1.0 and reading anything from blogs about The Simpsons, to *very* personal updates, and everything in between. GeoCities neighbourhoods were great fun to parse through and learn.

### Web 1.0 design
Take pretty much any website today and it's like to have something similar to cookie-cutter design we've all become accustom to.
* Sidebar with related posts ‚úÖ
* A header that contains a hamburger menu ‚úÖ
* Mahoosive features images ‚úÖ
* All the JavaScript ‚úÖ
* All the tracking ‚úÖ
* All the adverts ‚úÖ
* Maybe, just *maybe*, some useful content ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Back in the Web 1.0 days, web design (if you can call it that) was *very* different to how it is today. Scrolling marquees, blinking text, all the GIFs. It was great!

CSS was still in its infancy, so you couldn't do all the cool stuff we can do today, which meant people had to think out side the box. Sure, accessibility was pretty low down the people's priorities (read: not there at all) but some of the designs were amazing, unique and most of all, interesting.

Looks at those glorious manifestations of 90s web design! Quite a lot different from the cookie-cutter design of today, right?

Lucky for us, there are still some parts of the Internet that are [weirdly wonderful](https://weirdwidewebring.net/) and [wildly whimsical](https://whimsical.club/).

## Then came Web 2.0
This is where things all start to go to rat shit. Web 2.0 is when a shift social media and interactive platforms came about.

Instead of having interesting content creators sharing their experiences and knowledge on their personal blogs, we started to see pictures of people's lunch, political and social hyperbole and a whole load of other shit to boot.

### Fuck social media
The rise of social media flipped content creation on its head. Instead of deliberately creating and editing content for blogs, people were now empowered to quickly and easily vomit their passing thoughts out to the world.

On the face of things, this may sounds great. Social media is empowering people to easily create content online, allowing anyone with an Internet connection to have a voice.

The problem here, dear reader, is that social media was never about empowering people. Nope, was it fuck. It was all about one thing...

**MONEY!**

All the time you're surfing your favourite social network, looking at what that person you haven't seen for 20 years and would never *ever* speak to on the street is up to, you're being tracked like a mother fucker.

Facebook is by far the worst offender for this. If they wanted to, those fuckers would be able to tell how much your shit smells. But why all the tracking? Well, again it comes down to money.

They track you so they can use this data to empower more targeted ads on the platform; by having highly targeted ads, you're more likely to click. And if you're more likely to click, they make more money.

**[Mark Zuckerberg doesn't give two shits about your privacy](https://www.businessinsider.com/well-these-new-zuckerberg-ims-wont-help-facebooks-privacy-problems-2010-5?r=US&IR=T) - if you're a Facebook user, you should be re-considering your life choices.**

### Fuck search engines
Although Zuckerberg and his merry band of wankers have a lot to answer for, the death of web 1.0 and the humble personal blog is not their fault alone. Search plays a huge part in this shit show.

Back in the day, search engines were rudimentary at best, but they have now grown into these Goliath things were even [Google don't really understand how their shit works](https://www.seroundtable.com/google-dont-understand-rankbrain-21744.html).

In some ways this is good, as we get far more accurate search results. But it also has 2 very important problems too. Let me explain...

Firstly, as with social media, it's all about money. So the humble personal blog generally get wrapped out of search rankings, and is replaced my corporate entities that have teams of people on hand who can manipulate the search rankings to their will.

We call this *Search Engine Optimisation* (SEO) in the industry.

The second problem is that because of all the aforementioned tracking, your Google search results become an echo chamber. You see, Google learns as you search and the more data you feed it, to more "accurate" the results become for you.

Try it yourself, do a Google search for something on your normal browser, then [download the TOR browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) and try the same search again. I guarantee the results will be different.

It's a double whammy. Corporate website owners are manipulating results so you're more likely to see their shitty listicle posts instead of actual useable content that's bee written by someone who knows that they're talking about. And Google are also manipulating the results based on your search habits.

With all of this fucking around with results, you're likely yo get the results you *think* you want, but you're unlikely to get the *best* results.

This has effectively killed off the humble personal blog. [Personal blogging isn't dead yet](https://metaletter.net/issue-01/), but it's *extremely* difficult to gain any traction with a blog these days.

## Don't fuck yourself
This is all very negative, isn't it. So let's inject some positivity into this shit show, shall we? *The web is fucked* that's a fact, but there are still ways you can take Web 1.0 and sprinkle it with a little Web 2.0 so that you can use it to your advantage.

### Don't be a social media shill
I'm not saying you should avoid all social media - that shit's pretty much impossible these days and is reserved mainly for social pariahs.

But you can choose which social platforms you use and how to use them in a healthy way. Here's some tips:

* Get the fuck off Facebook. That shit is a cancer.
* Look for decentralised alternatives, like [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org).
* Familiarise yourself with [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) and make your site the single source of truth for all your online content.

## Discovering Web 1.0 content in a Web 2.0 world
GeoCities is long gone. It's dead, Jim. But there are still ways of discovering Web 1.0 content and personal blogs, despite all the shit I've written about above.

[Neocities](https://neocities.org) is a modern day implementation of GeoCities and it's chock full of a great sites that would have all fit nicely in the Internet of the 90s and 00s.

![Neocities website browser](/assets/images/neocities-browser.webp)

Just like on GeoCities, you can spin up your own site for free too, and for a mere $5/month you can have things like a custom domain etc. It's great.

If you want to get *really* nostalgic, there are even pages on Neocities that are [similar to GeoCities neighbourhoods](https://districts.neocities.org/).

If Neocities isn't your thing and you want to discover more modern personal blogs ([like mine](https://kevq.uk/posts)) then I got you covered there too. Sites like [Blog Surf](https://blogsurf.io/) and [Personalsit.es](https://personalsit.es/) can help you discover some great personal sites.

## What about Web 3.0?
Don't worry, we're getting close to end now folks, but I wanted to quickly touch upon [Web 3.0 and the Metaverse](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-what-is-metaverse-and-web-30-060003351.html). If you don't know what these are; the Metaverse is what that dick head Zuckerberg is pushing with Meta. And Web 3.0 is basically blockchain on all the things.

Yeah, fuck that. Fuck blockchain. Fuck Meta. That's all I have to say about that.

## Fuck this
I'm done. There you have it, that's my manifesto about how fucked the web is. Look, we will never get the web of old back and let's be honest, it wasn't perfect either.

But a long as we use the web with our eyes open and try to take advantage of the few positives the web still provides, it *may* not be that bad.

Then again, the web might be completely and utterly fucked and it's only gonna get worse. One thing is for sure, if that dick head Zuckerberg has anything to do with it, things will *definitely* get worse.
