I have something to tell you, dear reader. **The web is fucked and there's nothing we can do about it.** It's a sad state of affairs that we're in - gone are the days of Web 1.0 where the humble personal blog and GeoCities reigned supreme.

Instead we've been left with Web 1.0's rotten remains where centralisation, monopolies and tracking are the order of the day. It's shit.

The Internet has been monetised by social media, my big tech, by search engines. Fuck, it's been monetised by pretty much everyone apart from those intrepid [netizens](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/netizen) from back in the late 90s and early 00s.

**This is my manifesto. A warning to everyone who uses the web; it's fucked and it's not gonna change.**

**Content warning:** If you hadn't noticed already - this manifesto is not suitable for work. It's full of swear words because I'm pissed off.

## What is Web 1.0?
I suppose a good place to start would be with some context. If you weren't a user of the Internet back in the 90s and 00s, then you're not likely to know what [Web 1.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0#Web_1.0) was.

In short, it was glorious. Many people had personal web sites, usually published on GeoCities, where exploring the web was a fun adventure that wasn't fuelled by algorithms.

You would find all kinds of web pages, about all kinds of topics. Search engine optimisation didn't exist, fuck, there were *no search engines* in the early days.

If you wanted to find something, you had to hunt for it and that was all part of the fun. There's a reason it's called *surfing the web* and that traditional browsers, like Netscape Navigator, had a nautical theme.

I fondly remember perusing Web 1.0 and reading anything from blogs about The Simpsons, to *very* personal updates, and everything in between. GeoCities neighbourhoods were great fun to parse through and learn.

### Web 1.0 design
Take pretty much any website today and it's like to have something similar to cookie-cutter design we've all become accustom to.
* Sidebar with related posts ‚úÖ
* A header that contains a hamburger menu ‚úÖ
* Mahoosive features images ‚úÖ
* All the JavaScript ‚úÖ
* All the tracking ‚úÖ
* All the adverts ‚úÖ
* Maybe, just *maybe*, some useful content ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Back in the Web 1.0 days, web design (if you can call it that) was *very* different to how it is today. Scrolling marquees, blinking text, all the GIFs. It was great!

CSS was still in its infancy, so you couldn't do all the cool stuff we can do today, which meant people had to think out side the box. Sure, accessibility was pretty low down the people's priorities (read: not there at all) but some of the designs were amazing, unique and most of all, interesting.

Looks at those glorious manifestations of 90s web design! Quite a lot different from the cookie-cutter design of today, right?

Lucky for us, there are still some parts of the Internet that are [weirdly wonderful](https://weirdwidewebring.net/) and [wildly whimsical](https://whimsical.club/).
