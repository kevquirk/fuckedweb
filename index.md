I have something to tell you, dear reader. **The web is fucked and there's nothing we can do about it.** It's a sad state of affairs that we're in - gone are the days of Web 1.0 and we've been left with the rotten remains that are the current web.

The Internet has been monetised by social media, my big tech, by search engines. Fuck, it's been monetised by pretty much everyone apart from those intrepid [netizens](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/netizen) from back in the late 90s and early 00s.

This is my manifesto. A warning to everyone who uses the web; it's fucked and it's not gonna change.

## What is Web 1.0?

## Fuck social media

## Fuck big tech

## Fuck search engines

## Don't fuck yourself
* Give examples on how content can be discovered
* POSSE - use social media as a **secondary platform**

## Fuck this
* There's nothing we can do - it's already too late
